# Bouncy Game

Hi! This is a simple Bouncy Game on Java. At the start of the game you are given a ball on a petal and several blocks up above that you have to break through. 
The ball will automatically start bouncing back and forth, and once it hits any of the blocks -- they pop. On the way back, however, it's your job to catch the 
ball with the petal. Once the ball touches the ground -- game is over. You win if you hit all the blocks and don't let the ball touch the ground. 

To run the game, download this repository, and run "Bouncy.java" file to begin. All the other files are supplementary classes used to implement the game. 
Changing any of the files may result in a broken game. 

Good luck and have fun time playing!
